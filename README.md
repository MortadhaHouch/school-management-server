Here is an enhanced version of the **Backend** section of your README with **icons**, **images**, and a visually engaging structure to make it appealing and user-friendly:

```markdown
# 🖥️ **Backend - School Management System**

The **Backend** of the School Management System is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**, leveraging the **Mongoose** library to manage interactions with the **MongoDB** database. It follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture for clean and maintainable code.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Framework**: Node.js & Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **ODM**: Mongoose
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Security**: Bcrypt for password hashing

## 🔐 **Authentication**

Authentication is managed using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**. A user must first register and then log in to receive a token, which must be included in the headers of requests to access **authenticated endpoints**.

1. **Register** a user: POST `/register`
2. **Login** a user: POST `/login`
3. Include the JWT in headers for all subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

---

## 🏗️ **Models**

### 🧑‍💻 **User Model**
Defines the structure for user data.

```typescript
interface User {
  _id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // Hashed password
  name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'teacher' | 'student';
  enrolledCourses: Types.ObjectId[];
}
```

### 📚 **Course Model**
Defines the structure for course data.

```typescript
interface Course {
  _id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  duration: number; // in hours
}
```

### 🏠 **Room Model**
Defines the structure for room data.

```typescript
interface Room {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  capacity: number;
  status: boolean; // true for available, false for unavailable
  course: Types.ObjectId;
}
```

### ⏰ **TimeSchedule Model**
Defines the structure for course time schedules.

```typescript
interface TimeSchedule {
  _id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  createdBy: Types.ObjectId;
}
```
